# Befunge

This is quite a fast interpreter for [Befunge-93](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Befunge).

## State

Approximately 90% compatability. Most programs I've found run perfectly, but  
some misbehave. I'm debugging, slowly but surely.

## How to build:

### Production:

```
make
```

### Development

```
make devel
```

## How to run

```
./befunge *my-befunge-program.file*
```
